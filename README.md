# <ins>Manipulating Qudit States using Qiskit Pulse</ins>

Qiskit Pulse allows for pulse level control access to the quantum systems. Such pulse level access to quantum systems lets one manipulate quantum systems to finer levels and perform computations beyond what is possible through the gate model. In this project, we aim to use Qiskit Pulse to exploit the higher energy states of a quantum system to realize the qutrit model of computation. We do the same by using the second excited state of the quantum system and constructing universal single and double qutrit gates using pulses. We follow this realization by a simulation of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model also using Qiskit Pulse.
